# Holiday 2020 Hometown Hope

COVID has severely impacted many families in our community.  And, many local businesses and restaurants are struggling to survive.

[F3 Churham](www.f3churham.com) is raising money to provide restaurant gift certificates for families in need this holiday season.  By giving gift certificates to local restaurants, this is a unique opportunity to double your impact on our community.  Every dollar you donate helps twice.  It helps a local restaurant and a family in need.

**Who is raising the money?**

This fundraiser is started by the [F3 community](www.f3churham.com). F3 is a free, peer-led workout group of guys that meet all over the state and far beyond.

**Where is the money going?**

The money is going to buy gift cards from local struggling restaurants in the Chapel-Hill and Durham metro area.  And, we are working with local community organizations to distribute them to struggling families.  So, every dollar you donate helps our community twice!

## Two fundraising campaigns, One Goal!
