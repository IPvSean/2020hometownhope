# Holiday 2020 Hometown Hope

COVID has severely impacted many families in our community.  At the same time, many local businesses and restaurants are struggling to survive.  F3 Churham is raising money to provide restaurant gift certificates for families in need this holiday season.  By giving gift certificates to local restaurants, this is a unique opportunity to double your impact on our community.  Each dollar you donate helps twice.  It helps a local restaurant and a family in need.
