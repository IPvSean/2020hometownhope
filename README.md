# Holiday 2020 Hometown Hope

COVID has severely impacted many families in our community.  At the same time, many local businesses and restaurants are struggling to survive.  F3 Churham is raising money to provide restaurant gift certificates for families in need this holiday season.  By giving gift certificates to local restaurants, this is a unique opportunity to double your impact on our community.  Each dollar you donate helps twice.  It helps a local restaurant and a family in need.

**Who is raising the money?**

This fundraiser is started by the [F3 community](f3churham.com). F3 is a free, peer-led workout group of guys that meet all over the state and far beyond.  However to be more inclusive of everyone in our community, we are opening it up to anyone and everyone!  See the links below!

**Where is the money going?**

The money is going to buy gift cards from local struggling restaurants in the Chapel-Hill and Durham metro area and handed to food-insecure or struggling families so they can have nice meals during the holiday.  We will choose restaurants across Chatham, Orange and Durham counties to spread the hope to everyone we can.  This will allow us to simultaneously help local businesses while helping families have nice meals during this pandemic.
